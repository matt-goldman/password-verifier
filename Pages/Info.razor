            The point is to illustrate why it's a <strong>bad idea to re-use usernames and passwords</strong> across different websites and services. It's not just malicious websites (like this pretend one for example) 
            that you have to worry about; if you re-use your credentials across services, and one of those has a breach and your credentials are leaked, hackers now have access to <strong>everything</strong>
            you used the same username and password for. If you use a different password for each site, then they only have access to the one that was leaked.
